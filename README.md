# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP)
## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **console-based Bank Account Simulation** built using **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. ⚙️  
It demonstrates how a banking system can handle **account creation 🆕, deposits 💰, withdrawals 💳, and transaction history 📜** using **classes 🏷️, inheritance 🧬, and method overriding 🔄**.  
The program allows the user to create either a **Savings Account 💵** (with minimum balance rule) or a **Current Account 💼**, and then perform transactions interactively. 🎮  
## 🎯 Why I Built This  
I developed this project to:  
- 📚 Practice **Java OOP concepts** such as classes 🏷️, objects 🧩, inheritance 🧬, encapsulation 🔒, and polymorphism 🔀.  
- 🏦 Understand how real-world banking operations can be represented programmatically.  
- 🧠 Strengthen my problem-solving skills with **console-based interaction** 💻.  
- ⌨️ Gain hands-on experience with **user input handling** using `Scanner`.  
## ✨ Features  
- 🏷️ Create **Savings 💵 or Current 💼 Account** based on user choice.  
- 💰 Perform unlimited **Deposits** and **Withdrawals**.  
- 📏 Enforce **rules for different account types**:  
  - 💵 **Savings Account** → Must maintain a minimum balance.  
  - 💼 **Current Account** → Standard withdrawal rules.  
- 📜 View complete **Transaction History**.  
- 🖥️ Menu-driven **interactive console system**.  
- 🔒 Data encapsulated within classes and methods.  
## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated  
- ☕ **Java Programming**  
- 🧩 **OOP Concepts**:  
  - 🏷️ Classes and Objects  
  - 🧬 Inheritance  
  - 🔄 Method Overriding (Polymorphism)  
  - 🔒 Encapsulation  
- 📚 **Collections Framework** → `ArrayList` used for transaction history  
- ⌨️ **User Input Handling** → `Scanner`  
- 💻 **Console-based Application Development**
